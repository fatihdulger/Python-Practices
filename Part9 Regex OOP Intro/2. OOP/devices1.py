""" To understand the meaning of classes we
have to understand the built-in __init__() function.
All classes have a function called __init__(), which is
 always executed when the class is being initiated.
 Use the __init__() function to assign values to object
 properties, or other operations that are necessary to do
 when the object is being created:  """

# what is a constructor in python?
# it is a method that is called when an object is created
# This method is defined inside the class and can be used to initilise variables
